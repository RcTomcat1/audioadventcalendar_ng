# audioadventcalendar_ng


This will be the new version of the Audio Adventcalendar I made in 2011. It uses an JQ6500 mp3 module instead of the waveshield, which makes the code much more easier and readable and makes the whole circuit much smaller if using an Arduino Nano instead of the UNO.


----

There are some minor mistakes in the instructions. I'll collect them here, so you can build without hassleling...


* Folder Structure:
  as mentioned by [Landixus](https://github.com/Landixus) ([Issue #3](https://github.com/mischk/audioadventcalendar_ng/issues/3) the folder structure on the sd-card must be like: /00/0xx.mp3.
  Folder Name is 00 NOT 000.
